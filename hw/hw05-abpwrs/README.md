## Grading desire.
- [x] I will *NOT* submit any content to this repository, and I
      confirm that my midterm exam score shall be used for my HW5 score.
      (No other changes are necessary, submit changes to this file only) 
- [ ] I am providing updated answers for all components of the questions,
      and I would like HW05 graded independant of the midterm exam.  
      (Change all other necessary files for the problems defined.)

## Course `Multi-Dimensional Image Analysis Tools Tools and Techniques`

### Evaluation emphasis in this course:

Broad exposure to common tools of medical imaging analysis in commercial, clinical, and research settings, including algorithm development (using C+++ and ITK), rapid prototyping (SimpleITK, nipype, ipython notebook), statistical analysis (R), machine learning (scikit-learn, keras/tensorflow) and reproducible science tools (python, git, bash); special emphasis on big data challenges associated with volume, velocity, and veracity; real-world settings for problems include image-guided robotic surgery, dose treatment planning, and image analysis.

Your ability to demonstrate `reproducible science` in for `big data challenges` using the course 
tools is of paramount importance.
The process used is evaluated with more emphasis than a numerical answer for a single exemplar data set.


`README.md` <-- This file

For this HW, you are required to complete 3 tasks
that are described in greater detail in the following
files:

- [ ] 15pts QUESTIONS/TASK.md
- [ ] 50pts EdgeSlicerModule/TASK.md  (You will need to modify the CMakeLists.txt files.)
- [ ] 35pts ComputeInterPupilaryDistance/TASK.md


## Good Luck.


HINTS:
The `XXXX` and `TODO` designations in the reference code indicate that in one
of many possible solutions there is code or documentation that would
be needed to make a complete solution.

        -- XXXX is a hint.  It is not required that you put something there.
        -- XXXX is a hint.  It does not indicate that those are the only places that need content added.
        -- There are relatively few code line changes to be made.  You should not be writing 100's of lines of code.
        -- `ITK_LIBRARIES` is an imporant CMake variable that you may need
        -- `ITK_DIR=/nfsscratch/opt/ece5490/ITK/v5.0.0.20190314/src/ITK_5.0.0_debug-bld`
        -- `SlicerExecutionModel_DIR=/nfsscratch/opt/ece5490/SlicerExecutionModel/src/SEM_debug-bld`

Think before you type.  Guessing will likely take you down very bad paths to wrong answers.

Commit early, Commit often.

It is more important to convey what you know than to get exactly the correct answer.
        
        -- Not giving an answer has a 100% chance of earning a maximum of 0 points
        -- Adding a comment that describes what you would do allows earning of 
           partial credit.  BE SPECIFIC and use the proper terminology.
