# CurvatureAD
I found the following behavior for the parameter of Curvature Anisotropic Diffusion  

A smaller conductance value includes more noise.   
A smaller time step value appears to provide more clear resolution.  
The number of iterations has a direct impact on the run time and depending on what the number of iterations is, it can effect the amount of noise in the output.
