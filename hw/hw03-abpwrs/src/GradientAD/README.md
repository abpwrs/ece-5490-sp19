# GradientAD
I found the following behavior for the parameter of Gradient Anisotropic Diffusion.     
A smaller conductance value includes more noise, while a larger conductance results in a blurry image.      
A smaller time step value appears to provide more clear resolution, but a decrease in the amount of noise that is removed.    
The number of iterations has a direct impact on the run time and depending on what the number of iterations is, it can effect the amount of noise in the output.
