# GaussianLPF
In Gaussian Low Pass Filtering, as the value of sigma is increased the image becomes more blurry. 
This is because a larger sigma includes more information in the calculation of one resultant pixel.

I found that parameters around one resulted in effective noise removal without loosing too much resolution.
